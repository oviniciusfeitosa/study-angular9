## Recommendations

- Use of the Ivy compiler to gain application performance. **Ivy is the code name for Angular's next-generation compilation and rendering pipeline.**
- RxJS
  - [Working with subject and eliminating subscribes to ng-destroy](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/subject)
  - Divide routes correctly using lazy load so that all routes are not loaded without the need
